# Data Download Instructions

Due to file size limitations (>100MB), the input data files are hosted on Google Drive and must be downloaded manually.

## Required Files
- `SPM.h5ad`  - Spatial metabolic data
- `SPT.h5ad`  - Spatial transcriptomic data

## Download Instructions
1. Access the Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/113Si1InBZl64LBvPSwkoMgFELIwljfVA?usp=drive_link
2. Download both `SPM.h5ad` and `SPT.h5ad` files
3. Place the downloaded files in this directory (`spatial_metabolic_RNA_data/InputData/`)

## File Structure After Download
```
spatial_metabolic_RNA_data/InputData/
├── SPM.h5ad
├── SPT.h5ad
└── downloadData.txt
```

**Note**: Ensure both files are downloaded completely before proceeding with data analysis.
